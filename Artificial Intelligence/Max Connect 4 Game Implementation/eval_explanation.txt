-> Evaluation function :
       AiPlayer.findBestPlay():
        This method uses the minmax algorithm along with alpha beta pruning and depth limited search to make the best move the computer can make to win or tie the game.
        It takes current game board state as input.
        For each valid column inputted, it calls the Min_Utility() or Max_Utility() depending on the player.
        Max_Utility()  and Min_Utility(): takes 4 parameters gameboard, depth, alpha and beta. They run until depth becomes 0. They use alpha beta pruning and each time reduces depth by 1.
        The findBestPlay() returns the optimal column number decided by the function.
